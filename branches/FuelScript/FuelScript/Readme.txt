This script based on the Ultimate Fuel Script v2.1.0.0 source by "pedro2555" and
this is just an improved version of it. Further development done by me.
Thanks goes to "pedro2555".

TO INSTALL: Just unzip/extract the contents of the ZIP file you downloaded to
GTA IV root directory folder. Keep the folders and paths intact (SlimDX.dll should
be placed in the GTA IV root folder where GTAIV.exe exist, and everything else
should be at "scripts" folder, as in ZIP file). You need .NET Script Hook v1.7.1.7
BETA, XLiveLess ASI loader (for ScriptHook) and this script developed and
tested on GTA IV 1.0.7.0 (recommended).

WARNING: This script also shares Ultimate Fuel Script's GUID (which is
"3583e09d-6c44-4820-85e9-93926307d4f8"). So don't use these two script
together or it will cause a conflict in some events.

You don't need to worry, every help and which keys you should use will be
provided to you as ingame instructions when you using this script. And almost
everything is customizable to your needs.

Tip: Incase if your game prompted "GTA IV FATAL ERROR: Invalid resource
detected - Please re-install the game" error just ignore it and start the game
again. It won't occur again, just the first time script get installed.
