POTENTIAL ERRORS NEEDS FIXING

ERROR #1
ERROR DETAILS	  :  Script crashes when player tried to inject a fuel bottle to a bus.
                   Crash occurs at the end of the animation which is in doVehicleRepair()
                   function. I suspect it's because of the longer time player takes to get
                   off the bus than a normal vehicle may not enough to the waiting times
                   we put there (maybe this error is present on all vehicles with
                   "+big" flag?).
REPRODUCE STEPS	:  Go to a bus depot or the time square and get on a bus. Drive it until
                   the fuel is depleted (increasing draining speed of buses may save your
                   time). Then press the bottle use key (default U) to use a fuel bottle
                   and right where the player gets in to the bus, script crashes!
