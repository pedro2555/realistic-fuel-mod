This script is based on the Ultimate Fuel Script v2.1.0.0 source by Pedro Rodrigues
<prodrigues1990@gmail.com> and this is just an improved version of it.
Further development done by Sandakelum <sandakelum2009@gmail.com>.

INSTALLATION: 
Just unzip/extract the contents of the ZIP file you downloaded to
GTA IV root directory folder. Keep the folders and paths intact (SlimDX.dll
should be placed in the GTA IV root folder where GTAIV.exe exist, and everything
else should be at "scripts" folder, as in ZIP file). You need .NET Script Hook
v1.7.1.7 BETA and all it's dependencies, XLiveLess ASI loader (for ScriptHook) and this script is developed
and tested on GTA IV 1.0.7.0 (recommended).

This script also shares Ultimate Fuel Script's GUID (which is
"3583e09d-6c44-4820-85e9-93926307d4f8"). So don't use these two script together
or it will cause a conflict in some events.

USAGE:
You don't need to worry, every help and which keys you should use will be
provided to you as ingame instructions when you using this script. And almost
everything is customizable to your needs.

FAQ:
Q. GTA prompted an error : "GTA IV FATAL ERROR: Invalid resource
detected - Please re-install the game".
A. Just retry, the error should be gone. It sometimes happens when running the script for the first time.

Q. Can I add entries in the settings (.ini) file for added, not replaced cars ?
A. Yes, use a trainer (Simple Native Trainer is recommended) and take note of the HASH code for that specific car. Open the settings file copy and paste any car/bike/boat/heli entry, and change the name of vehicle (inside []) to the hash code of your car. The values specified in this new entry should be loaded for your added cars, there is no limit to how many entries you can have.

Q. Can you add stealing points for fuel ?
Q. The LCPD helicopter landing pad in the center island, is a fuel stealing location for helicopters. Alternatively you can define your own locations by adding a new entry to the settings file, up to 254 entries for each station type.
